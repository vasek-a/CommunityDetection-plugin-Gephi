#This heuristic computes similarity of k-th most similar neighbour (called k-nearest) for each node. All computed k-nearest similarities are then sorted and rendered in chart. A typical k-nearest similarity plot is shown in picture below. The knee indicated by a vertical line shows that an appropriate epsilon value for shown sample graph is 0.7.
