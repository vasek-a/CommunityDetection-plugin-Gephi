MarkovAlgoClustererPanel.header.description_1=Clustering algorithm based on absorbing markov chains proposed by A. Kumar. \nThe algorithm uses k-means for initial cluster association and continues by expectation-maximization steps. \nObjective function is calculated as sum of probabilities that a node is absorbed by its assigned cluster.
