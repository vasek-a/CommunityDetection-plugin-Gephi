LinkClustererPanel.header.description=In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, \nlink communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. \nWe find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks \nsuch as protein-protein interaction6 and metabolic networks and show that a large social \nnetwork contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city \nto regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that \nlink communities are fundamental building blocks which reveal overlap and hierarchical organization\n in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.
